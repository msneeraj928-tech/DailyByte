## 🎯 Expected Approach

### Key Concepts
- Counting digits in a number
- Extracting individual digits
- Power/exponentiation operations
- Sum calculation

### Sample Test Cases
```
Input: 153 → Output: true (1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153)
Input: 9474 → Output: true (9⁴ + 4⁴ + 7⁴ + 4⁴ = 9474)
Input: 123 → Output: false
Input: 9 → Output: true (single digit)
```

## 📊 Complexity Requirements

- **Time Complexity:** O(d) where d is the number of digits
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) for mathematical approach, O(d) for string approach
