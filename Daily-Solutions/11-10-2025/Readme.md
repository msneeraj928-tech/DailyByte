## 🎯 Expected Approach

### Key Concepts
- Hash Set data structure
- Array traversal
- Order preservation
- Uniqueness checking

### Sample Test Cases
```
Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5] → Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Input: [5, 5, 5, 5] → Output: [5]
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] → Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Input: [] → Output: []
Input: [3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2] → Output: [3, 1, 2, 4]
```

---

## 📊 Complexity Requirements

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the array
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the set and result array

## 💡 Tips

- Use a Set to track elements you've already seen
- Iterate through the array once for O(n) time complexity
- Preserve the order of first occurrence
- Handle empty arrays gracefully
- Test with arrays containing all duplicates and all unique elements
- Consider edge cases with negative numbers
