## 🔍 How to Study Solutions

### Best Practices

1. **Solve First, Then Look**
   - Always attempt the problem yourself first
   - Solutions are most valuable after you've struggled with the problem
   - Compare your approach with others

2. **Understand, Don't Copy**
   - Read the code carefully
   - Understand the logic and reasoning
   - Try to implement it yourself without looking

3. **Analyze Complexity**
   - Check the time and space complexity
   - Compare with your solution
   - Understand why certain approaches are more efficient

4. **Learn from Comments**
   - Read the approach explanations
   - Understand the thought process
   - Learn new techniques and patterns

5. **Try Different Languages**
   - See how the same logic is implemented in different languages
   - Learn language-specific idioms
   - Appreciate different programming paradigms

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 🚫 Viewing Solutions Before Deadline

**DO NOT** view solutions for a problem before the submission deadline if you plan to submit your own solution.

**Why?**
- It defeats the learning purpose
- It's considered academic dishonesty
- You won't develop problem-solving skills

### ✅ When to View Solutions

- **After you've submitted** your own solution
- **After the deadline** has passed
- **For problems** you're not planning to submit

### 🎯 Ethical Use

- Use solutions to **learn**, not to **copy**
- Understand the **logic**, don't memorize the **code**
- **Compare approaches** after solving independently
- **Give credit** when discussing solutions

## 💡 Tips for Contributors

### Writing Quality Solutions

1. **Clear Variable Names**
   ```python
   # Good
   uppercase_count = 0
   current_char = string[i]
   
   # Bad
   cnt = 0
   c = s[i]
   ```

2. **Helpful Comments**
   ```python
   # Good
   # Skip tilde characters when counting position
   if char == '~':
       result.append(char)
       continue
   
   # Bad
   if char == '~':  # check
       result.append(char)
       continue
   ```

3. **Test Cases**
   ```python
   # Include test cases that verify correctness
   def test():
       assert solution("input") == "expected"
       assert solution("edge_case") == "expected"
   ```

4. **Complexity Analysis**
   ```python
   """
   Time Complexity: O(n) - single pass through string
   Space Complexity: O(n) - result string of same length
   """
   ```
