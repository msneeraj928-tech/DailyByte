## 📋 Problem: Palindrome String

**Date:** November 7, 2025  
**Difficulty:** 🟢 Easy  
**Topics:** String Manipulation

### Problem Description

Given a string `s`, determine whether it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. Consider only alphanumeric characters and ignore cases.

## ✅ Submission Checklist

Before submitting, ensure your solution includes:

- [ ] **Header Comment Block** with:
  - Problem name: Palindrome String
  - Date: 11-07-2025
  - Your name and GitHub username
  - ERP ID
  - Approach explanation
  - Time and space complexity analysis

- [ ] **Clean, Well-Documented Code**:
  - Meaningful variable names
  - Proper indentation and formatting
  - Inline comments for complex logic
  - No commented-out code

- [ ] **Correctness**:
  - Handles all test cases correctly
  - Edge cases handled (empty string, special characters, mixed case, etc.)
  - No runtime errors

- [ ] **Testing**:
  - Tested with provided examples
  - Additional edge cases verified

---

## 🎯 Expected Approach

### Key Concepts
- Two-pointer technique
- String filtering and manipulation
- Case-insensitive comparison
- Character validation (alphanumeric)

### Sample Test Cases
```
Input: "racecar" → Output: true
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" → Output: true
Input: "hello" → Output: false
Input: "Was it a car or a cat I saw?" → Output: true
Input: "" → Output: true (empty string is palindrome)
```

## 📊 Complexity Requirements

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the string
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) for two-pointer approach, O(n) for filter approach
