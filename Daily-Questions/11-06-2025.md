## Day 11-06-2025: Armstrong Number

### Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, determine whether it is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number (also known as narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

For example:
- 153 is an Armstrong number because 153 = 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
- 9474 is an Armstrong number because 9474 = 9⁴ + 4⁴ + 7⁴ + 4⁴ = 6561 + 256 + 2401 + 256 = 9474

Return `true` if the number is an Armstrong number, otherwise return `false`.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: n = 153
Output: true
Explanation:
153 has 3 digits, and 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
```

### Example 2
```
Input: n = 9474
Output: true
Explanation:
9474 has 4 digits, and 9⁴ + 4⁴ + 7⁴ + 4⁴ = 6561 + 256 + 2401 + 256 = 9474
```

### Example 3
```
Input: n = 123
Output: false
Explanation:
123 has 3 digits, and 1³ + 2³ + 3³ = 1 + 8 + 27 = 36 ≠ 123
```

### Example 4
```
Input: n = 9
Output: true
Explanation:
9 has 1 digit, and 9¹ = 9
```

### Example 5
```
Input: n = 370
Output: true
Explanation:
370 has 3 digits, and 3³ + 7³ + 0³ = 27 + 343 + 0 = 370
```

## Constraints

- 1 <= n <= 10^9
- n is a positive integer

## Follow-up

Can you solve this problem without converting the number to a string? How would you handle very large numbers efficiently?

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
First, you need to count the number of digits in the number. You can do this by converting to a string or using logarithm.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Extract each digit of the number and raise it to the power of the total number of digits. You can extract digits using the modulo operator (%) and integer division (/).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
Sum all the powered digits and compare with the original number.
</details>

## Suggested Approach (short contract)

- Input: an integer `n`.
- Output: a boolean indicating whether `n` is an Armstrong number.
- Error modes: if `n` is less than or equal to 0, return false or handle as per requirements.
- Success: correctly identify Armstrong numbers.

Edge cases:
- Single-digit numbers (all are Armstrong numbers).
- Numbers with zeros in them.
- Large numbers close to the constraint limit.

## Time & Space Complexity

- Time: O(d) — where d is the number of digits in n (constant for fixed-size integers).
- Space: O(1) — constant extra space if computing in-place, O(d) if converting to string.

## Example Implementation Ideas

### Approach 1: Using String Conversion
- Convert the number to a string to easily count digits and extract each digit.
- Calculate the sum of each digit raised to the power of total digits.
- Compare with the original number.

### Approach 2: Mathematical Approach
- Count digits using logarithm: `digits = floor(log10(n)) + 1`
- Extract digits using modulo and division operations.
- Calculate the sum of powered digits.
- Compare with the original number.
