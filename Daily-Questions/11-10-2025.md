## Day 11-10-2025: Remove Duplicate Numbers from Array

### Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, remove all duplicate elements from the array and return a new array containing only the unique elements. The order of elements in the result should be the same as their first occurrence in the original array.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Explanation:
The duplicates (second occurrence of 2 and 4) are removed, keeping only unique elements in their original order.
```

### Example 2
```
Input: nums = [5, 5, 5, 5]
Output: [5]
Explanation:
All elements are the same, so only one instance is kept.
```

### Example 3
```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Explanation:
All elements are already unique, so the array remains unchanged.
```

### Example 4
```
Input: nums = []
Output: []
Explanation:
Empty array returns empty array.
```

### Example 5
```
Input: nums = [3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2]
Output: [3, 1, 2, 4]
Explanation:
Keeping only the first occurrence of each element: 3, 1, 2, and 4.
```

## Constraints

- 0 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

## Follow-up

Can you solve this problem in O(n) time complexity? What if you need to maintain the original array and return a new one?

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Consider using a Set data structure to keep track of elements you've already seen. Sets naturally handle uniqueness.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Iterate through the array once, and for each element, check if it's already been seen. If not, add it to both the result and the seen set.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
The order matters! Make sure to preserve the order of first occurrence by iterating from left to right and maintaining insertion order in your result.
</details>

## Suggested Approach (short contract)

- Input: an integer array `nums`.
- Output: a new array with duplicate elements removed, preserving order of first occurrence.
- Error modes: handle empty arrays gracefully.
- Success: correctly remove all duplicates while maintaining order.

Edge cases:
- Empty array (should return empty array)
- Array with all same elements (should return array with single element)
- Array with all unique elements (should return the same array)
- Array with negative numbers
- Large arrays close to the constraint limit

## Time & Space Complexity

### Approach 1: Using Set/Hash Set
- Time: O(n) — single pass through the array.
- Space: O(n) — for storing seen elements in the set and result array.

### Approach 2: Nested Loop (Brute Force)
- Time: O(n²) — for each element, check all previous elements.
- Space: O(n) — for the result array only.

## Example Implementation Ideas

### Approach 1: Hash Set (Recommended)
- Create an empty set to track seen elements.
- Create an empty result array.
- Iterate through the input array.
- For each element, check if it's in the seen set.
- If not seen, add to result and mark as seen.
- Return the result array.

### Approach 2: Using Dictionary/Map
- Similar to the set approach but using a dictionary to track seen elements.
- Useful if you need to store additional information about each element.

### Approach 3: Built-in Functions
- Some languages offer built-in ways to remove duplicates while preserving order.
- Example: Python's dict.fromkeys() or using OrderedDict.

public:
    vector<int> removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Your code here
    }
};
```
