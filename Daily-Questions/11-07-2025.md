## Day 11-07-2025: Palindrome String

### Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, determine whether it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

For this problem, consider only alphanumeric characters and ignore cases. This means you should:
- Ignore non-alphanumeric characters (spaces, punctuation, etc.)
- Treat uppercase and lowercase letters as the same

Return `true` if the string is a palindrome, otherwise return `false`.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: s = "racecar"
Output: true
Explanation:
"racecar" reads the same forward and backward.
```

### Example 2
```
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation:
Ignoring spaces and punctuation, and treating uppercase as lowercase:
"amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
```

### Example 3
```
Input: s = "hello"
Output: false
Explanation:
"hello" is not the same as "olleh" when reversed.
```

### Example 4
```
Input: s = "Was it a car or a cat I saw?"
Output: true
Explanation:
Considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases:
"wasitacaroracatisaw" is a palindrome.
```

### Example 5
```
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation:
"raceacar" is not equal to "racaecar" when reversed.
```

## Constraints

- 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
- s consists of printable ASCII characters including letters, digits, spaces, and punctuation.

## Follow-up

Can you solve this problem using O(1) extra space? What if you had to check if a linked list of characters is a palindrome?

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Use two pointers - one starting from the beginning and one from the end. Move them toward each other while comparing characters.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Skip non-alphanumeric characters and convert all letters to the same case (either upper or lower) before comparing.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
Alternatively, you can first filter out all non-alphanumeric characters, convert to lowercase, and then check if the string equals its reverse.
</details>

## Suggested Approach (short contract)

- Input: a string `s`.
- Output: a boolean indicating whether `s` is a palindrome (considering only alphanumeric characters, case-insensitive).
- Error modes: if `s` is empty or has no alphanumeric characters, return true (empty string is a palindrome).
- Success: correctly identify palindromes.

Edge cases:
- Empty string.
- String with only spaces or punctuation.
- Single character string.
- String with mixed case letters.
- String with numbers and letters.

## Time & Space Complexity

### Approach 1: Filter and Reverse
- Time: O(n) — where n is the length of the string (filtering and comparing).
- Space: O(n) — storing filtered string.

### Approach 2: Two Pointers
- Time: O(n) — single pass with two pointers.
- Space: O(1) — constant extra space (no new string created).

## Example Implementation Ideas

### Approach 1: Filter and Reverse
- Filter the string to keep only alphanumeric characters.
- Convert all characters to lowercase.
- Compare the filtered string with its reverse.

### Approach 2: Two Pointers
- Use two pointers (left and right) starting at both ends.
- Skip non-alphanumeric characters.
- Compare characters after converting to the same case.
- Move pointers toward the center.

public:
    bool isPalindrome(string s) {
        // Your code here
    }
};
```
