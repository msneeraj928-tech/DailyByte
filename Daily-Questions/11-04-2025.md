## Day 11-02-2025: SpOoKy~CaSe

### Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Statement

You are given a string representing a variable name. Convert it to "spooky case" using the following rules:

- Replace all underscores (`_`) and hyphens (`-`) with a tilde (`~`).
- Capitalize the first letter of the string, and then alternate case for each subsequent character (uppercase, lowercase, uppercase, ...). When counting positions for alternating case, ignore the tilde characters — they should remain `~` in the output and not affect the alternation count.
- Non-letter characters (digits, punctuation) should remain unchanged, but they do count toward the alternation (unless they are `~`).
- Preserve the order of characters; only change separators and letter casing.

Return the transformed string.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: "hello_world"
Output: "HeLlO~wOrLd"
Explanation:
- Replace '_' with '~' → "hello~world"
- Apply alternating capitalization (ignore '~' while counting): H e L l O ~ w O r L d → "HeLlO~wOrLd"
```

### Example 2
```
Input: "spooky-case"
Output: "SpOoKy~CaSe"
Explanation:
- Replace '-' with '~' → "spooky~case"
- Alternating capitalization (ignore '~'): S p O o K y ~ C a S e → "SpOoKy~CaSe"
```

### Example 3
```
Input: "a_b-c"
Output: "A~b~C"
Explanation:
- Replace '_' and '-' → "a~b~c"
- Alternating capitalization (ignore '~'): A ~ b ~ C → "A~b~C"
```

### Example 4 (non-letters)
```
Input: "var_1-name"
Output: "VaR~1~NaMe"
Explanation:
- Replace separators → "var~1~name"
- Count characters excluding '~': v(1) a(2) r(3) 1(4) n(5) a(6) m(7) e(8)
- Apply alternating capitalization starting with uppercase for character 1:
  v -> V, a -> a, r -> R, 1 -> 1 (non-letter but counts), n -> N, a -> a, m -> M, e -> e
- Result → "VaR~1~NaMe"
```

## Constraints

- 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
- s consists of printable ASCII characters.
- The string may contain letters, digits, underscores (`_`), hyphens (`-`), and other punctuation.
- Treat `~` as a literal separator if already present; do not replace `~` (but do ignore it when counting positions).

## Follow-up

Can you implement this in O(n) time and O(1) extra space (aside from the output string)? What changes if you must perform the transformation in-place on a mutable character array?

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
First replace all `_` and `-` with `~` (you can do this in a single pass).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Use a boolean flag (or an index counter) that tracks whether the next non-`~` character should be uppercase or lowercase. Flip it after processing any non-`~` character.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
When changing case, check whether the character is a letter; non-letters should be preserved but still counted in the alternation.
</details>

## Suggested Approach (short contract)

- Input: a string `s`.
- Output: a new string where `_` and `-` are replaced with `~`, and non-`~` characters are alternately cased starting with uppercase.
- Error modes: if `s` is empty, return an empty string.
- Success: produce the correctly transformed string.

Edge cases:
- Empty string.
- Strings containing only separators (e.g., "___" → "~~~").
- Strings with digits/punctuation (they remain unchanged but count).
- Strings that already contain `~` characters.

## Time & Space Complexity

- Time: O(n) — single pass to transform characters.
- Space: O(n) — output string of same length as input (O(1) extra working space if allowed to modify in-place on a mutable array).

## Example Implementation Ideas

- Iterate once, build an output list/array of chars; for each char:
  - If char is `_` or `-`, append `~` and continue (do not flip the case counter).
  - Else if char is `~`, append `~` (do not flip the counter).
  - Else (non-`~`), decide upper/lower based on the current state; if char is a letter, change case; otherwise append as-is. After appending a non-`~` char (letter or not), flip the state.
