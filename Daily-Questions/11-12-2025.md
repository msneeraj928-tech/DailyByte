## Day 11-12-2025: Reverse the Array

### Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, reverse the array. You should modify the array in-place or return a new reversed array.

Reversing an array means that the first element becomes the last, the second element becomes the second-to-last, and so on.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Explanation:
The array is reversed: first element (1) becomes last, last element (5) becomes first.
```

### Example 2
```
Input: nums = [10, 20, 30]
Output: [30, 20, 10]
Explanation:
Simple reversal of three elements.
```

### Example 3
```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation:
Single element array remains the same when reversed.
```

### Example 4
```
Input: nums = [7, 7, 7, 7]
Output: [7, 7, 7, 7]
Explanation:
When all elements are the same, the reversed array looks identical.
```

### Example 5
```
Input: nums = [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]
Output: [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1]
Explanation:
Reversal works the same way with negative numbers.
```

## Constraints

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

## Follow-up

Can you reverse the array in-place with O(1) extra space? What is the minimum number of swaps required to reverse an array?

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Use two pointers: one at the start and one at the end of the array. Swap elements and move the pointers towards the center.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
You only need to iterate through half of the array. When the left pointer meets or crosses the right pointer, you're done.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
For in-place reversal, swap elements at positions i and n-1-i where n is the array length and i goes from 0 to n/2.
</details>

## Suggested Approach (short contract)

- Input: an integer array `nums`.
- Output: the reversed array.
- Error modes: handle edge cases like single-element or empty arrays (though constraints say length >= 1).
- Success: correctly reverse the array.

Edge cases:
- Array with single element (remains unchanged)
- Array with two elements (simple swap)
- Array with even length
- Array with odd length
- Array with all same elements
- Array with negative numbers

## Time & Space Complexity

### Approach 1: Two Pointers (In-place)
- Time: O(n) — iterate through half the array.
- Space: O(1) — only use constant extra space for swapping.

### Approach 2: Using Extra Array
- Time: O(n) — create new array with reversed elements.
- Space: O(n) — new array to store the result.

### Approach 3: Using Built-in Functions
- Time: O(n) — language-dependent implementation.
- Space: Varies — depends on whether it's in-place or creates a new array.

## Example Implementation Ideas

### Approach 1: Two Pointers (Recommended)
- Initialize left pointer at index 0 and right pointer at index n-1.
- While left < right:
  - Swap elements at left and right indices.
  - Increment left and decrement right.
- Return the array (or it's already modified in-place).

### Approach 2: Iteration with New Array
- Create a new array of the same size.
- Iterate through the original array from the end to the beginning.
- Copy each element to the new array from start to end.
- Return the new array.

### Approach 3: Using Stack
- Push all elements onto a stack (LIFO structure).
- Pop elements and place them back into the array.
- The stack naturally reverses the order.

### Approach 4: Recursion
- Recursively swap elements from both ends moving towards the center.
- Base case: when left >= right, stop.
