## Day 11-11-2025: Single Rotation of Array

### Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps. A single rotation means moving each element one position to the right, with the last element wrapping around to the first position.

For example, rotating `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` once to the right gives `[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

Rotate the array `k` times and modify it in-place (or return the rotated array).

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 1
Output: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation:
After 1 rotation to the right: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Example 2
```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 2
Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
Explanation:
After 1 rotation: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
After 2 rotations: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```

### Example 3
```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], k = 3
Output: [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation:
The last 3 elements move to the front.
```

### Example 4
```
Input: nums = [1, 2], k = 3
Output: [2, 1]
Explanation:
k = 3 is greater than array length (2).
After rotation 1: [2, 1]
After rotation 2: [1, 2]
After rotation 3: [2, 1]
(k % length = 3 % 2 = 1, so effectively rotate once)
```

### Example 5
```
Input: nums = [1], k = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation:
No rotation needed when k = 0.
```

## Constraints

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- 0 <= k <= 10^5

## Follow-up

Can you do this in-place with O(1) extra space? Can you solve it using the reversal algorithm?

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
If k is greater than the array length, rotating by k is the same as rotating by k % length. This can simplify your solution.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Think about which elements end up where. After k rotations, the element at index i moves to index (i + k) % n.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
The reversal algorithm: Reverse the entire array, then reverse the first k elements, then reverse the remaining elements. This achieves rotation in O(n) time and O(1) space.
</details>

## Suggested Approach (short contract)

- Input: an integer array `nums` and an integer `k` (number of rotations).
- Output: the array rotated k times to the right.
- Error modes: handle edge cases like k = 0 or k > array length.
- Success: correctly rotate the array.

Edge cases:
- k = 0 (no rotation needed)
- k >= array length (use k % length)
- Array with single element
- Empty array (though constraints say length >= 1)
- k is very large (use modulo)

## Time & Space Complexity

### Approach 1: Using Extra Array
- Time: O(n) — single pass to copy elements.
- Space: O(n) — temporary array to store rotated elements.

### Approach 2: Reversal Algorithm
- Time: O(n) — three reversals, each O(n/3) on average.
- Space: O(1) — in-place rotation.

### Approach 3: Cyclic Replacements
- Time: O(n) — visit each element once.
- Space: O(1) — constant extra space.

## Example Implementation Ideas

### Approach 1: Using Extra Array
- Create a new array of the same size.
- For each element at index i, place it at (i + k) % n in the new array.
- Copy the new array back to the original (or return it).

### Approach 2: Reversal Algorithm (Recommended for in-place)
- Normalize k: k = k % n (where n is array length).
- Reverse the entire array.
- Reverse the first k elements.
- Reverse the remaining n-k elements.
- This achieves the rotation in-place.

### Approach 3: Element by Element
- Perform k single rotations by repeatedly moving the last element to the front.
- Less efficient but straightforward.
