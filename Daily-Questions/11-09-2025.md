## Day 11-09-2025: Decimal to Binary Conversion

### Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Statement

Given a non-negative integer `n` in decimal form (base 10), convert it to its binary representation (base 2) and return the result as a string.

The binary representation should not have leading zeros, except when the number itself is 0.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: n = 5
Output: "101"
Explanation:
5 in decimal = 101 in binary
5 = 1×2² + 0×2¹ + 1×2⁰ = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5
```

### Example 2
```
Input: n = 10
Output: "1010"
Explanation:
10 in decimal = 1010 in binary
10 = 1×2³ + 0×2² + 1×2¹ + 0×2⁰ = 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10
```

### Example 3
```
Input: n = 0
Output: "0"
Explanation:
0 in decimal = 0 in binary
```

### Example 4
```
Input: n = 1
Output: "1"
Explanation:
1 in decimal = 1 in binary
```

### Example 5
```
Input: n = 17
Output: "10001"
Explanation:
17 in decimal = 10001 in binary
17 = 1×2⁴ + 0×2³ + 0×2² + 0×2¹ + 1×2⁰ = 16 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 17
```

## Constraints

- 0 <= n <= 10^9
- n is a non-negative integer

## Follow-up

Can you implement this without using built-in conversion functions? How would you handle negative numbers using two's complement representation?

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
To convert decimal to binary, repeatedly divide the number by 2 and keep track of the remainders. The binary representation is the remainders read in reverse order.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
You can use the modulo operator (%) to get the remainder when dividing by 2, and integer division (//) to get the quotient.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
Build the binary string from right to left by prepending each remainder to the result, or collect remainders in a list and reverse it at the end.
</details>

## Suggested Approach (short contract)

- Input: a non-negative integer `n`.
- Output: a string representing the binary form of `n`.
- Error modes: if `n` is negative, handle appropriately (can return error or use two's complement).
- Success: correctly convert decimal to binary.

Edge cases:
- n = 0 (should return "0")
- n = 1 (should return "1")
- Powers of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.)
- Large numbers close to the constraint limit

## Time & Space Complexity

### Approach 1: Division Method
- Time: O(log n) — number of divisions needed is proportional to the number of bits.
- Space: O(log n) — storing the binary string which has log₂(n) + 1 bits.

### Approach 2: Bit Manipulation
- Time: O(log n) — checking each bit position.
- Space: O(log n) — storing the result string.

## Example Implementation Ideas

### Approach 1: Division by 2 Method
- Handle the special case when n = 0.
- Repeatedly divide n by 2.
- Collect the remainder (0 or 1) at each step.
- Continue until n becomes 0.
- Reverse the collected remainders to get the binary representation.

### Approach 2: Bit Manipulation
- Find the position of the most significant bit.
- Iterate from that position down to 0.
- Check if each bit is set using bitwise AND operation.
- Build the binary string accordingly.

### Approach 3: Using Built-in Functions (Language Specific)
- Most languages have built-in functions like `bin()` in Python or `Integer.toBinaryString()` in Java.
- While using these is valid, try implementing the algorithm manually for learning.
